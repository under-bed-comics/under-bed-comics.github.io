## Chapter 1
There once lived a charming phoenix who had hypnotic eyes. Who went on a journey to find people who wanted to live with him. One day he came over a hill and found a peaceful village called Hogsmead and everybody who lived there was Christian and they believed that the phoenix was powerful and brought good spirit they thought that he was going to give them a blessing when he asked them if they wanted to live with him they all put up their hands and he asked who was the littlest and whoever that was was going to live in the bedroom next to his.

They would have to hike up 60 kilometers to get to his palace on the way he found a lady phoenix and her name was Jennifer and she asked if she could live with him and when he said yes she started walking with them they had already gone 50 kilometers and there were 10 left. He wanted to stop and go to his friend's farm to get some food for the banquet at his palace, everybody agreed to stop and rest because they were exhausted.

His friend's name is Tom and is also a phoenix and his food was grown by a magical garden his tomato plants went 218 meters into the sky his beans went 250 meters into the sky and his broccoli was ginormous you could see the broccoli from China it was so big. At the palace they sat in for the banquet and the servants carried the delicious food on golden plates. Everyone was happy at their new home. The phoenix made a speech, he said I hope you are happy at the palace your rooms are waiting for you on levels three to six.

## Chapter 2
The next morning the phoenix got up bright and early and to his astonishment everyone was waiting for him in the great hall. Everyone except for Bill for he had gone out to Tom's farm to get some more food for breakfast. Bill didn't come back until 9:30 because when he came back he saw a shooting star that went across the galaxy that was red and green. Bill then found a valuable picture on the ground in front of the palace steps and money leading away that only meant one of two things - the phoenix had been robbed or something much less likely. When he got to the great hall to his surprise he found that no one was in there, so he checked out back and found all the others except the phoenix with a security camera computer. He asked them what they were doing and they said it was prank that Lily had thought of. They would lay out one of the most valuable pictures in the palace by the steps and pour money by it. There was security camera on top of the doorstep so they could watch him.

They said the phoenix was in his office wondering where his most valuable picture was and a bag of his money.

## Chapter 3
After they had breakfast, they played a huge round of Twister then went inside for lunch. Alicia Spinnit went up to her room for a nap. The phoenix thought that was a good idea, so he had a nap too while the others secretly cleaned up the palace. They found a giant spider hiding in the ginormous attic.

When the phoenix got up from his nap, he got scared when he was coming out of the door of his room because the giant spider had escaped when the guests tried to catch it. He shrank the spider with his magical powers and put it in the conservatory with his birds of all kinds.

While he was in the conservatory, a bald eagle came pelting at his head because it had seen a rabbit that was rubbing his leg and it was trying to catch the rabbit. The phoenix saved the rabbit by jumping at the bald eagle (phoenixes are powerful) so the phoenix won the fight. Then he left the conservatory and went to the library to look up an eagleâ€™s weak point. It happened to be the chest.

## Chapter 4
The next day at breakfast the phoenix found that everyone was waiting for him except for Hillary who was out getting breakfast. On her way back, Hillary saw the same shooting star that Bill had. She got out her telescope to look at the red and green shooting star, then she took a picture through the telescope by putting her camera to the telescope and pointing it on target and it came out closer because of the telescope. She hurried to the palace to show everyone the picture she had taken.

The phoenix knew about the shooting star because Bill had told him but Bill had not had his camera on him.
